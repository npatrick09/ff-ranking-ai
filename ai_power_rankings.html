    <h1>Kappa Concealed Carry Power Rankings - Week 1</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Church Chatter</strong> (1-0) - PF: 123.66 / PA: 89.16
            <p>Church Chatter is scoring points like a preacher at a revival. With Josh Allen throwing darts and a defense that’s tougher than your Uncle Jerry after three beers, they’re not just winning; they’re making opponents feel like they’ve been struck by divine intervention. Enjoy the top spot while it lasts, fellas!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Indy’s dad</strong> (1-0) - PF: 104.92 / PA: 103.62
            <p>Indy’s dad barely scraped by with a win so close it should come with a warning label. Proving that sometimes it’s not about how you play, but rather how little you can get away with, they’re the poster child for “winning by the skin of your teeth.” Just don’t get too comfy; it’s a long season ahead!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DEVastation</strong> (0-1) - PF: 103.62 / PA: 104.92
            <p>DEVastation? More like Devastated! They lost by a hair, but with injuries piling up like bad decisions, they’re looking for a miracle just to get off the mat. With Travis Kelce leading the charge, let’s hope they can turn that frown upside down before it’s too late!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You Understand Right?</strong> (1-0) - PF: 93.64 / PA: 78.68
            <p>You Understand Right? clearly do, as they cruised to a victory with a score that’s barely scraping by. But don’t get too cozy, folks; that performance might just be a one-hit wonder, and we all know those don’t last long in this league!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pervy Patrick</strong> (1-0) - PF: 92.58 / PA: 82.18
            <p>Pervy Patrick had a decent debut, but let’s be real, their injuries are stacking up faster than their points. If they don’t get their stars back on the field, they might just turn into a soap opera that nobody wants to watch!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bonnie Lu</strong> (1-0) - PF: 90.92 / PA: 66.92
            <p>Bonnie Lu strutted their stuff with a convincing win, and with a point differential like that, they must feel like they’re on top of the world. But remember, the higher you climb, the harder the fall, and they better not slip on that banana peel!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Moff Gideon</strong> (0-1) - PF: 89.16 / PA: 123.66
            <p>Moff Gideon is off to a rocky start, and with a point differential of -34.5, they might want to rethink their strategy. When your team looks more like a practice squad, it’s a long road to redemption, buddy!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Check Please</strong> (1-0) - PF: 82.88 / PA: 78.12
            <p>Check Please managed a win, but it was about as comfortable as a middle seat on a packed flight. They’ll need to step it up or risk being left behind in the dust because this isn’t a game for the faint of heart!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stugletary</strong> (0-1) - PF: 82.18 / PA: 92.58
            <p>Stugletary is off to a disappointing start, feeling more like a slow crawl than a sprint. They might need to pick up the pace if they want to avoid being the league’s doormat this season!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Don Quan</strong> (0-1) - PF: 78.68 / PA: 93.64
            <p>Don Quan is still searching for their first win, and with a score that barely registers, they might want to consider a new game plan. At this rate, they’re just playing for pride—and that’s not exactly a trophy!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>champagnepapi707</strong> (0-1) - PF: 78.12 / PA: 82.88
            <p>champagnepapi707 is drowning in the bottom of the standings with a performance that’s flatter than a cheap bottle of bubbly. Here’s hoping they can pop off next week, or they’ll be the league’s sad punchline!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>They Hit The 2nd Bower</strong> (0-1) - PF: 66.92 / PA: 90.92
            <p>They Hit The 2nd Bower are off to a rough start, and with a score that looks more like a bad joke, they might want to consider switching their strategy before it’s too late. They’re in danger of becoming the league’s punchline, and nobody wants that!</p>
